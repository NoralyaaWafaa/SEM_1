Hybrid Industry Talk

## Reflection
> I recently attended an industrial talk featuring Ts. HJ Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology and Innovation from Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd, who shared deep insights about project management and System Development Life Cycle ( SDLC ). Throughout the session, he explained the phases in SDLC by illustrating the concepts with examples related to daily chores, such as the preparation of Nasi Lemak. Furthermore, he also introduced several SDLC models, including Agile and Waterfall, which are commonly used in project development. This session enabled me to gain exposure on how the theoretical concepts learned in class are applied in real-life scenarios. Before this talk, I believe that system development was mostly focused on using coding to solve human problems or to develop systems to improves quality of life. However, now I realize that approximately 60% of a project's success depends on effective planning, risking management, secure design architecture and project management skills.
> Moving forward, I was informed about the skill sets currently required by the industry to become a competent IT professional and also allowing us to stand out in this competitive environment. I realized that be in this constantly evolving field, I need to always learn, explore and enhance my skills so that I can remain competent and competitive.
