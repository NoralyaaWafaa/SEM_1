## Reflection
> Design Thinking is a problem-solving framework used by the designer to develop products and spaces. It is a unique approach to problem solving because it focuses entirely on humans at the center of the problem. Meaning that, it goes beyond improvement to truly understanding and finding solutions. For our task, we designed and proposed a non-functional prototype of a computerised system aimed at supporting the Disadvantaged Community, with specific focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Our group developed a solution focusing on ASD parents and caregiver; a website that serves as an online support community. It provides services such as booking specialist daycare, a space to share experiences and connect with others on the same path and access to a personal AI companion designed on verified research and our sharing community. Through this project, I realised how capable and powerful modern technology is in improving lives. However, no matter how much powerful the tech is, the backbone remains human empathy and self-awareness.
