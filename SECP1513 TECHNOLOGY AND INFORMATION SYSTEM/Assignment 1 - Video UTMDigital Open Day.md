## Reflection
> On 29 October 2025 I engaged in a one hour talk regarding to system development by Mr. Helmee Bin Yaacob, Senior IT Officer from Department of Digital Services.
> Then, we also had the apportunity to interview one of the UTMDigital staff asking questions related to network and security of UTM websites.
> Through this visit I gained a lot of knowledge on the importances of my course in maintaining the stability of an organization.
> I have learned how network security department implements their routine system audits protocols to prevent a critical security incident.
> I believe this information has opened new avenues and allowed me to outline new goals for my career path.
> This event was eye-opening to us computer science students however, it could be even better if the vanue is more spacious for the sake of everyone's comfort.
