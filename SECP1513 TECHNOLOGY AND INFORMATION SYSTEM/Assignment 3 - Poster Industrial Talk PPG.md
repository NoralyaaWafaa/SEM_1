## Reflection
> On 20 November, PPG company held an online session with UTM students via Webex. The talk was meant to introduce the company's background, discuss responsibilities of
> a few key sectors, to emphasizing the importance of Information Communication Technology ( ICT ) in today's modern industry. Through this talk session, I gained
> exposure to the work scope of various departments such that SAP, Infrastructure and Data Analytics. It became clear that these departments alongside
> network security department play a crucial roles in achieving the company's vision and mission. Beside that, I gained new knowledge about Global Marine Hull
> Navigator, which is one of the analytical tools that have been used by the Data Analytics department to predict and detect issues. In conclusion, this online talk
