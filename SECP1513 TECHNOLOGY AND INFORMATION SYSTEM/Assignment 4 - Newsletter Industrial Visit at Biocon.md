## Reflection
> On 23 December, two section of students under the supervision of Dr. Azurah has visited a biotechnology company that specializes in manufacturing devices for human insulin and insulin
> analogs located in Iskandar Puteri, Johor. During this visit students and lecturers had been divided into three group to explore different departments which is
> drug substance, R&D and drugs product. Through this visit, I have gained new perspectives on the significance and contribution of modern technologies into the
> medical field. I learned the significance of time-to-time monitoring. In the production process, every phase were documented and analyzed to ensure the
> manufactured products meet international quality standards. These standards have been established by organizations like International Council for Harmonisation
> (ICH) and World Health Organization (WHO).
