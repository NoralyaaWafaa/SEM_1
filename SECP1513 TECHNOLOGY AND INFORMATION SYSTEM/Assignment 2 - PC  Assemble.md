## Reflection

> In this session, students were seated in groups and provided a PC to practice assemble and disassemble. Under the guidence of the lab assistants we succesfully
> completed each procedure. Through this hands-on session I get to know how to manage sensitive computer components or ESD-sensitive components such as RAM and CPU
> with caution. Furthermore, I get to experienced assembling, disassembling, component verification and testing a functional PC along with the importance of
> documentation and double checking the actions. Overall, this was a valuable learning experience and I would like to thank Dr. Azurah for providing this great
> opportunity.
